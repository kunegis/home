** Keyboard shortcut for upvoting (e.g. "a").
*** The one Firefox extension that exists doesn't work because it also changes
    the background color of comments in a way that interferes with Dark Reader.
** Find a Firefox plugin that redirects from any instance to my home instance
*** Tried one, didn't work.
** Card view by default
*** Will probably be implemented.
** Block all users from one instance
** Inside a post, sort comments by Top by default
** "Best" sorting option that also shows posts in small communities
*** Will probably be implemented.
